# HMM forward and backward algorithm

## Description
This is a homework of Machine Learning and AI Algorithm, a curriculum that I take.


Its subject is Hidden Markov Model and the forward and backward algorithm.


In the course of my implementation of these algorithms, I found classical version of algorithms have a difficulty on dealing with variable-length sequence. So I tried a method, that is filling up a sequence to a pre-determined length with itself. With this method, it suppose to augment and fortify the feature of each sequence and solve "length problem".

## TODO
- [x] learn http knowledge
- [x] program a python script to wash data
- [x] write down calculation process of HMM forward and backward algorithm
- [x] program a python script to generate {H, A, B}
- [x] prepare a normal http require and a malicious one, if time permit, prepare a random one
- [x] program a python script to judge these two requests
- [x] prepare ppt, result pics, model pics, description pics and other necessary pics
- [x] restructure programs
- [ ] prepare report
- [x] upload to github
